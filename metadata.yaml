description: '"Esther" is a very nice English story of a young girl who becomes a
  governess and is so sweet and amiable that all love her. Esther is a beautiful English
  girl who is introduced to the reader just as she graduates from a fashionable boarding
  school at the age of 17. She is a thoroughly good and unselfish girl - a ''nice''
  girl.  The story is pure, bright, natural, and entertaining.'
